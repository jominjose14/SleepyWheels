          <ul>
            <li>
              If feeling sleepy during a journey, stop somewhere safe, take
              drinks containing caffeine and take a short nap.
            </li>

            <li>
              Plan the journey to include regular rest breaks (a break of at
              least 15 minutes at least every two hours)
            </li>

            <li>
              Avoid setting out on a long drive after having worked a full day
            </li>

            <li>
              Avoid driving into the period when they would normally be falling
              asleep
            </li>

            <li>Avoid driving in the small hours (between 2am and 6am)</li>

        <div class="tip-list">
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Jump rope:</b> This is one of the best exercises you can do.
              It’s a great calorie burner, you can do it most anywhere, it
              strengthens muscles in your lower body and core, and it’s a
              lower-impact exercise than jogging. Best of all, it helps get your
              lymphatic system moving, which flushes waste out of your system.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Run in place:</b> It gets your heart rate up and you can do it
              anywhere. If you have a treadmill nearby, feel free to use it, but
              if you don’t have one, don’t let that stop you from getting up to
              move. Running in place doesn’t replace actual running, but if
              you’ve got only five minutes, it could help wake you up while
              burning some calories.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Perform a few burpees:</b> A “burpee” is an exercise in which
              you do a series of movements and end up back where you started.
              First, you jump straight up in the air, land and go into a squat,
              jump your feet back into a plank position, do one push-up, jump
              your feet up to your hands and move into another squat, and stand
              back up, ready to jump again if you can! A couple of these and
              you’ll be breathing hard and ready to go.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Clean something:</b> We’re talking real cleaning here, not just
              reorganizing your papers. Take everything off the desk and wipe it
              down with a cleaning solution. If you have a home office, vacuum,
              or clean up the kitchen or bathroom. If you’ve got an office
              coffee break area, take a few minutes to make it sparkle.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Dance:</b> Turn on your favorite music and move as you please.
              Granted, this one is harder to do in a public place, but if you
              can get into a room where you feel safe, plug in your headphones
              and go for it. Bonus benefit: According to a 2003 study, frequent
              dancing reduced risk of dementia!
